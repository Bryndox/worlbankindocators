        "World Development Indicators includes data spanning up to 56 years—from 1960 to 2016. "
        "World view frames global trends with indicators on population, population density, "
        "urbanization, GNI, and GDP. As in previous years, the World view online tables present "
        "indicators measuring the world’s economy and progress toward improving lives, achieving "
        "sustainable development, providing support for vulnerable populations, and reducing gender "
        "disparities. Data on poverty and shared prosperity are now in a separate section, while "
        "highlights of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals are now presented in the "
        "companion publication, Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2017.\n\n"

        "This app lists a selected set of World Bank Indicators and gives reference to online resources "
        "where each indicator can be broken down further into useful statistical information."
